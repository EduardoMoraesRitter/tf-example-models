# tf-example-models
TensorFlow-based implementations of several machine learning models (first three - LogReg, MLP, and CNN - inspired by Google tutorials from tensorflow.org). **models** folder contains simple implementations of:

* Logistic Regression (tf_logreg.py)
* Multi-layer Perceptron (tf_mlp.py)
* Convolutional Neural Network (tf_cnn.py)
* K-Means Clustering (tf_kmeans.py)
* Gaussian Mixture Model (tf_gmm.py)

**gmm** folder contains more elaborate versions of a Gaussian Mixture Model implementation (with diagonal covariance, full covariance, gradient-based). **gmm/struct** folder contains initial attempts to structurize the GMM implementation into a set of classes.
