# tf-example-models
TensorFlow-based implementation of several machine learning models (first three - LogReg, MLP, and CNN - inspired by Google tutorials from tensorflow.org):

- Logistic Regression (tf_logreg.py)
- Multi-layer Perceptron (tf_mlp.py)
- Convolutional Neural Network (tf_cnn.py)
- K-Means Clustering (tf_kmeans.py)
- Gaussian Mixture Model (tf_gmm.py)
